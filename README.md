# Tweety-Web
What!?! Another Twitter based project? Am I crazy? Yep, you guessed it! This time, It's [Tweety](https://github.com/ctcuff/Tweety) but implemented in JavaScript. More info coming soon...

#TODO:

* Add authentication?
* Fix a bug where pressing stop sometimes won't stop the stream
* Implement this as a static website outside of Electron
