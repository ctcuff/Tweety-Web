# Tweety-Web
What!?! Another Twitter based project? Am I crazy? Yep, you guessed it! This time, It's [Tweety](https://github.com/ctcuff/Tweety) but implemented in JavaScript. Enter a keyword or multiple keywords to search for and watch the Tweets fly (pun intended). Click on any tweet to be brought to that status on the user's homepage on twitter.com

### TODO:

* Add authentication?
* ~~Fix a bug where pressing stop sometimes won't stop the stream~~
* Implement this as a static website outside of Electron?
